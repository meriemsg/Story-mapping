Design and implement an application that allows to manage projects in collaborative mode
with agility. It is a web-based platform, dedicated to managing tasks, including project
monitoring, time and team collaboration. In fact, it is a method dedicated to managing sprints
based on the Redmine API by offering extremely flexible planning and monitoring
capabilities.

## Goals
1.  Planning the different sprints.
2.  Identify and detail the most important features in different steps.
3.  Cut the project into small pieces that make sense in order to quickly get something.
4.  Have a global vision of the functional scope.
5.  Alignment of project actors.
6.  Sharing Priorities.
7.  Initializing the “backlog”.
## Features
Our “story mapping” system must meet the following functional requirements:
- View project storymap from “Epics” and “User Stories”
- Creation and assignment of issues
- Drag and drop issues between “Activities”, “Epics” and Sprints
- Connecting to agile project management tools: Redmine, Jira…
- Authenticate

## Future Features :
- Detect notifications of project progress on my personal smartphone to be
able to manage work remotely.

remotely, you are notified on your smartphone as soon as an employee adds
or comments on a task.
- An inbox that organizes real-time information updates
